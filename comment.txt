Comments about Andrew Tate (he):
Text: This &quot;journalist&quot; is a bot from the matrix and cant even comprehend what andrew is saying. She is not listening and only responding for a reaction. The fact that she cant even do proper research shows that her assignment here was to damage his reputation and get him somehow to twist his words. They sent someone to try and make him slip up, using wordplay and provacative questions but completely FAILED. CHECKMATE TATE

Text: First of all she wasn&#39;t there to interview him and hear him out,she was there to accuse him and pour her anger and insecurities on him, she always use the one your influence, because you have a huge influence on the public and she get upset abt him saying he&#39;s one of the most influential people on earth, which is true if not the almighty BBC won&#39;t be at his house, he has not been charged and he was arrested jailed and detained, place on house arrest he has enough money to run and hide if he want but still he didn&#39;t, that lady took it personal and Tate took it as another podcast To beat time.

Text: 100% Andrew is right here. I&#39;ve watched the full videos of some of those points she&#39;s trying to make and he&#39;s telling the truth in regards to what the context is and what he actually said.<br>That being said, if he did commit those crimes, I hope there&#39;s justice, but I don&#39;t know the facts so I can&#39;t make a judgment about that.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: All those years Andrew has been in the ring, facing aggressive opponents; all his adversity and his many years of chess experience has prepped him for this interview. Not to mention he has Truth, the public and a spiritual force on his side.<br><br>She doesn&#39;t not realise what a formidable force she is up against.<br><br>A true microcosm of the dark force verses the Truth.

Sentiment: Positive

Text: Tate is not ‚Äúgood ‚Äú or ‚Äúbad‚Äù . He‚Äôs a yang to the yin on the war against men and general societal misandry that that is being pushed against males (and specifically white males ) he‚Äôs a necessary evil that was created by nature as a natural reaction to the current stimulus
Sentiment: Positive

Text: What if we are already like minded individuals that listen to Tate now what do you say? She is weak and whoever gave her this script is weaker puppets. They are on the matrix agenda and that is facts.
Sentiment: Neutral

Text: I&#39;m not a huge fan of Andrew Tate and disagree with a lot of stuff he&#39;s said in the past so I came into this expecting to think he&#39;d look like an idiot, but holy shit that reporter was so trash. Like he said they&#39;d just taken a few word snippets from the hundreds of hours of streaming he&#39;s done online and tried to use them as framing for him being an awful person and it honestly looks so pathetic and it&#39;s hard to watch. I still don&#39;t like Andrew Tate but I do respect his ability to put this shit reporter in her place cos this is laughable journalism.

Text: I actually respect the BBC so much more now. This is brilliant. <br>Not because it&#39;s a perfect interview. I definitely think it could&#39;ve been done better. The media had become very opinionated, flooded with personal opinions and agendas, which does stink but... Am I really the only one bothered by how Andrew is always so full of himself? I mean I&#39;m no therapist (but have been taking a deep interest in psychology for years), but to me - he shows absolutely zero empathy and stinks like a narcissist and that&#39;s EXACTLY what Lucy was trying to show with her questions (IMO), sadly nobody uses their head to analyse stuff and it&#39;s always &quot;LOOK HE WON HE&#39;S GOOD&quot; or &quot;HE SUCKS HE&#39;S MISOGYNIST&quot;. The real essence of things is usually much more  granular and complex, it&#39;s much more grey than black and white.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: They‚Äôve been doing this for years people they done the same thing to Michael Jackson but he was too kind to fight back, Andrew is a smart man and he makes sure to remind us that it‚Äôs the higher ups that are behind all this we all need to wake up and stop soaking up the lies like sponges üßΩ

Text: Prophecy effect?? Can it be possible that Dajjal aka AntiChrist team is heavily concerned with the revelation of Mehdi A.S.- A warrior of Islamic prophecy who would bring together all Muslim nations to fight against Dajjal. Right now, Andrew Tate is not on that level but nobody knows the upcoming future. What if, they are afraid the moment Andrew Tate accepted Islam and they thought that Andrew Tate may forgive himself and ask forgiveness for his sinful acts in past and come out as a very strong muslim and become the Mehdi A.S. as mentioned in prophecy!? So, they don&#39;t want to take the risk even if it is 1% and eliminate the danger to Dajjal aka Anti Christ and his plans especially to spread woke culture everywhere, make everyone become casual and synonymous with sins and men to behave like Lil princess and women to become degenerate..

Genuinely disappointing that Tate hasn‚Äôt been able to respond to real questions, with real statistics.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: I wish I was the one interviewing him, I would have been professional and I would&#39;ve not antagonized him like she&#39;s doing. And I also would have brought up some points that I would like him to clarify:<br><br>The voice note that he sent to the woman he allegedly raped (I would like to know what was the whole context behind that)<br>The statement he made saying that men can cheat while women can&#39;t (it doesn&#39;t really make sense)<br>The tweet he made saying that women should bear some responsibilities when they&#39;re raped (that was so wrong, but I would like to know what he meant, what kind of situation he was referring to)<br>Also, he says that a woman belong to her husband and I would like to know if he also believes that a man belongs to his wife cause that would make sense and not sound so wrong after all<br><br>This interview was ridiculous, I don&#39;t know why they sent her, she so obviously hates him and came with an agenda.

Don&#39;t know which one is the real one or which version his true character really is. A mixture of them both? I don&#39;t know, also when he was arrested could see it being true because of his online persona, however always believe innocent until proven guilty and should be treat as such. Most of the interviews he does he is very good, articulate and precise in everything he says and 9-10 comes off better than the interviewer however, in this he was very deflective and reluctant to clear up things from her loaded questions. Kept repeating statements she had made earlier even when it had nothing to do with the question she asked.

The BBC are simply a propaganda outlet for the New World Order/matrix agenda.<br><br>Her mission is to help target any alternative to this NWO agenda.

Text: This is proof that Andrew not only preaches but embodies stoicism, patience, and perseverance. I‚Äôve personally been evacuated from the war in Sudan, and posted a video on my channel about it. All I can say is whomever goes out of his way to help relieve the pain and suffering of people in war circumstances has a pure heart. Fuck the legacy media and their agenda, we stand with you Andrew.

Text: Very shallow interview from the BBC side. They dont have inteligence anymore. This woman was arrogant and loaded with shallow not well argumented statements and no evidences. Tate was nervous but thats understandable. Wesern media nd BBC are so bad these days. So so bad. This women....is so bad. She repeats the police, the police and some girl. What police what girl what the f*** are you talking about. Then she move on on some podcast 50 years ago when Tate`s speak with some onlyfans whores. This is the best BBC can do? C`moon man....this a joke. Really a joke. This was accusation after accusation not a inteview. Interview is when you ask questions not accusations :). And a fair interview is when you show both sides of the story.

Text: Tate is playing a character that rose him to  prominence &amp; the bad thing is he has to continue to play the relevance. Obviously he has said terrible things and he had said remarkable positive things. He is not the worst person in the world but it&#39;s so easy for media to come at him, why not other people we all know about. Leave the man alone

I don&#39;t want to watch Donald Trump answer an interviewers prewritten questions, I want to watch Donald Trump talk to Joe Rogan / Michel Malice / Dave Rubin ect.  for a couple hours, I want them to talk about things like a human not like a performer, we value hearing the people we look up to having conversations not interviews.

Idc who you are, if you are forced to be held in jail or prison for over 3 months with ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE against it, is just absolutely fucked up and an injust, misuse of power!
