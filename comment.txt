Comments about Andrew Tate (he):
Text: This &quot;journalist&quot; is a bot from the matrix and cant even comprehend what andrew is saying. She is not listening and only responding for a reaction. The fact that she cant even do proper research shows that her assignment here was to damage his reputation and get him somehow to twist his words. They sent someone to try and make him slip up, using wordplay and provacative questions but completely FAILED. CHECKMATE TATE

Text: First of all she wasn&#39;t there to interview him and hear him out,she was there to accuse him and pour her anger and insecurities on him, she always use the one your influence, because you have a huge influence on the public and she get upset abt him saying he&#39;s one of the most influential people on earth, which is true if not the almighty BBC won&#39;t be at his house, he has not been charged and he was arrested jailed and detained, place on house arrest he has enough money to run and hide if he want but still he didn&#39;t, that lady took it personal and Tate took it as another podcast To beat time.

Text: 100% Andrew is right here. I&#39;ve watched the full videos of some of those points she&#39;s trying to make and he&#39;s telling the truth in regards to what the context is and what he actually said.<br>That being said, if he did commit those crimes, I hope there&#39;s justice, but I don&#39;t know the facts so I can&#39;t make a judgment about that.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: All those years Andrew has been in the ring, facing aggressive opponents; all his adversity and his many years of chess experience has prepped him for this interview. Not to mention he has Truth, the public and a spiritual force on his side.<br><br>She doesn&#39;t not realise what a formidable force she is up against.<br><br>A true microcosm of the dark force verses the Truth.

Text: His a great influence..... I&#39;m a 40 year old male, and I&#39;ve been saying the same stuff Tate is saying for years, i just don&#39;t have the balls or the reach to be able to say what he is. Go the Tate brothers
Sentiment: Positive

Text: Tate is not “good “ or “bad” . He’s a yang to the yin on the war against men and general societal misandry that that is being pushed against males (and specifically white males ) he’s a necessary evil that was created by nature as a natural reaction to the current stimulus
Sentiment: Positive

Text: What if we are already like minded individuals that listen to Tate now what do you say? She is weak and whoever gave her this script is weaker puppets. They are on the matrix agenda and that is facts.

Text: I&#39;m not a huge fan of Andrew Tate and disagree with a lot of stuff he&#39;s said in the past so I came into this expecting to think he&#39;d look like an idiot, but holy shit that reporter was so trash. Like he said they&#39;d just taken a few word snippets from the hundreds of hours of streaming he&#39;s done online and tried to use them as framing for him being an awful person and it honestly looks so pathetic and it&#39;s hard to watch. I still don&#39;t like Andrew Tate but I do respect his ability to put this shit reporter in her place cos this is laughable journalism.

Text: I actually respect the BBC so much more now. This is brilliant. <br>Not because it&#39;s a perfect interview. I definitely think it could&#39;ve been done better. The media had become very opinionated, flooded with personal opinions and agendas, which does stink but... Am I really the only one bothered by how Andrew is always so full of himself? I mean I&#39;m no therapist (but have been taking a deep interest in psychology for years), but to me - he shows absolutely zero empathy and stinks like a narcissist and that&#39;s EXACTLY what Lucy was trying to show with her questions (IMO), sadly nobody uses their head to analyse stuff and it&#39;s always &quot;LOOK HE WON HE&#39;S GOOD&quot; or &quot;HE SUCKS HE&#39;S MISOGYNIST&quot;. The real essence of things is usually much more  granular and complex, it&#39;s much more grey than black and white.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: They’ve been doing this for years people they done the same thing to Michael Jackson but he was too kind to fight back, Andrew is a smart man and he makes sure to remind us that it’s the higher ups that are behind all this we all need to wake up and stop soaking up the lies like sponges 🧽
Sentiment: Positive

Text: How clear it is they had an agenda to try make him look bad backfired! nothing fair or unbais about reporting or journalism now days... just corrupt corrupt media trying to put the blame on a few outspoken people not looking at real problems in society where people (kids and adults) are being repressed, manipulated, controlled by governments, corruptions.... one man can&#39;t do all the damage they&#39;re trying to claim he&#39;s done to an entire country more people haven&#39;t heard of tate then have until now 😂 so fucking dum fuck the systems that controll us people will fight back and together we are more powerful then they&#39;re 😂😂😂 can feel the big cats shaking in their boots 🖕

Text: Prophecy effect?? Can it be possible that Dajjal aka AntiChrist team is heavily concerned with the revelation of Mehdi A.S.- A warrior of Islamic prophecy who would bring together all Muslim nations to fight against Dajjal. Right now, Andrew Tate is not on that level but nobody knows the upcoming future. What if, they are afraid the moment Andrew Tate accepted Islam and they thought that Andrew Tate may forgive himself and ask forgiveness for his sinful acts in past and come out as a very strong muslim and become the Mehdi A.S. as mentioned in prophecy!? So, they don&#39;t want to take the risk even if it is 1% and eliminate the danger to Dajjal aka Anti Christ and his plans especially to spread woke culture everywhere, make everyone become casual and synonymous with sins and men to behave like Lil princess and women to become degenerate..

Her line of questioning was very leading and she should have known Andrew is too learned to fall for that. It’s amazing how well Andrew remembers these comments and the contexts in which they were made. If he is guilty off anything, may the law have its course.

Text: I feel bad for the interviewer here. I think the BBC clearly can’t see the right way to interview Tate. All she has done is throw accusations at Tate, with limited research. The problem with the way she has executed this interview, is that her arguments are weak, and backed by no fact. Genuinely disappointing that Tate hasn’t been able to respond to real questions, with real statistics.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: I wish I was the one interviewing him, I would have been professional and I would&#39;ve not antagonized him like she&#39;s doing. And I also would have brought up some points that I would like him to clarify:<br><br>The voice note that he sent to the woman he allegedly raped (I would like to know what was the whole context behind that)<br>The statement he made saying that men can cheat while women can&#39;t (it doesn&#39;t really make sense)<br>The tweet he made saying that women should bear some responsibilities when they&#39;re raped (that was so wrong, but I would like to know what he meant, what kind of situation he was referring to)<br>Also, he says that a woman belong to her husband and I would like to know if he also believes that a man belongs to his wife cause that would make sense and not sound so wrong after all<br><br>This interview was ridiculous, I don&#39;t know why they sent her, she so obviously hates him and came with an agenda.

Don&#39;t know which one is the real one or which version his true character really is. A mixture of them both? I don&#39;t know, also when he was arrested could see it being true because of his online persona, however always believe innocent until proven guilty and should be treat as such. Most of the interviews he does he is very good, articulate and precise in everything he says and 9-10 comes off better than the interviewer however, in this he was very deflective and reluctant to clear up things from her loaded questions. Kept repeating statements she had made earlier even when it had nothing to do with the question she asked.

Tate was nervous but thats understandable. Wesern media nd BBC are so bad these days. So so bad. This women....is so bad. She repeats the police, the police and some girl. What police what girl what the f*** are you talking about. Then she move on on some podcast 50 years ago when Tate`s speak with some onlyfans whores. This is the best BBC can do? C`moon man....this a joke. Really a joke. This was accusation after accusation not a inteview. Interview is when you ask questions not accusations :). And a fair interview is when you show both sides of the story.

Text: well done tate for showing what a stoic man you are while engaging with this deranged NPC
Sentiment: Positive

Text: Tate is playing a character that rose him to  prominence &amp; the bad thing is he has to continue to play the relevance. Obviously he has said terrible things and he had said remarkable positive things. He is not the worst person in the world but it&#39;s so easy for media to come at him, why not other people we all know about. Leave the man alone

Text: Andrew Tate says &quot;this is a conversation&quot; and that is why these legacy media companies are going to die. I don&#39;t want to watch Donald Trump answer an interviewers prewritten questions, I want to watch Donald Trump talk to Joe Rogan / Michel Malice / Dave Rubin ect.  for a couple hours, I want them to talk about things like a human not like a performer, we value hearing the people we look up to having conversations not interviews.

Text: Yet the BBC allowed Jimmy Saville and such to work for them, hosting shows and covering up the truth about him. Yet they want to come and interview (well I wouldn’t call it an interview, more like bashing Andrew) Andrew Tate, and spread false information. Saying things like she said. It’s all abit of a contradiction on their behalf<br><br>EDIT: I’d like to see her interview Philip Schofield🫣🫣🫣

That’s what everyone used and abused who has no evidence but ruins anyone if they don’t get what they wanted.<br>She doesn’t even interested with the conversation but only focused on her questions and accusing him of manipulation. She is inventing things. She is rephrasing his statement and it’s all wrong. Andrew T is very intelligent and articulated.

Idc who you are, if you are forced to be held in jail or prison for over 3 months with ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE against it, is just absolutely fucked up and an injust, misuse of power!
