Comments about Andrew Tate (he):
Text: Respect for tate stand up for your beliefs
Sentiment: Positive

Text: This has to be one of the most biased interviews I have ever seen. Tate should have walked if after the first few minutes. Not one question about the fact that there has been no charges and Tate has been held as a prisoner for almost a year. I am going to encourage as many people I know to listen to the positive message that Tate brings. <br><br>Andrew, you are my brother.
Sentiment: Negative

Text: 100% Andrew is right here. I&#39;ve watched the full videos of some of those points she&#39;s trying to make and he&#39;s telling the truth in regards to what the context is and what he actually said.<br>That being said, if he did commit those crimes, I hope there&#39;s justice, but I don&#39;t know the facts so I can&#39;t make a judgment about that.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: All those years Andrew has been in the ring, facing aggressive opponents; all his adversity and his many years of chess experience has prepped him for this interview. Not to mention he has Truth, the public and a spiritual force on his side.<br><br>She doesn&#39;t not realise what a formidable force she is up against.<br><br>A true microcosm of the dark force verses the Truth.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: Since I start listening to Tate, I stopped any bad habit, focused on my work, and my life just got better. THANK YOU TATE. All respect and best wishes to Tate!
Sentiment: Positive

Text: His a great influence..... I&#39;m a 40 year old male, and I&#39;ve been saying the same stuff Tate is saying for years, i just don&#39;t have the balls or the reach to be able to say what he is. Go the Tate brothers
Sentiment: Positive

Text: Tate is not ‚Äúgood ‚Äú or ‚Äúbad‚Äù . He‚Äôs a yang to the yin on the war against men and general societal misandry that that is being pushed against males (and specifically white males ) he‚Äôs a necessary evil that was created by nature as a natural reaction to the current stimulus
Sentiment: Positive

Text: What if we are already like minded individuals that listen to Tate now what do you say? She is weak and whoever gave her this script is weaker puppets. They are on the matrix agenda and that is facts.
Sentiment: Neutral

Text: I&#39;m not a huge fan of Andrew Tate and disagree with a lot of stuff he&#39;s said in the past so I came into this expecting to think he&#39;d look like an idiot, but holy shit that reporter was so trash. Like he said they&#39;d just taken a few word snippets from the hundreds of hours of streaming he&#39;s done online and tried to use them as framing for him being an awful person and it honestly looks so pathetic and it&#39;s hard to watch. I still don&#39;t like Andrew Tate but I do respect his ability to put this shit reporter in her place cos this is laughable journalism.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: @24 minutes Andrew&#39;s leg began to shake - which is understandable. Most of us would have exploded in response to her disgusting assault.
Sentiment: Negative

Text: She claims Andrew said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a dangerous man‚Äù but people like her who are in the media, twisting words and changing the narrative I consider that far more dangerous. How unprofessional as well, bbc messed up big here. But I‚Äôm glad the majority if anything all of us are clearly starting to see the truth. <br>As a woman myself my mindset after listening to Andrew had changed for good, he is definitely a net positive to this society.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: I support you Mr tate<br>From Philippines üáµüá≠
Sentiment: Positive

Text: This Woman just doesn&#39;t get it, and she has taken everything he has said out of context, it&#39;s like her research comes from Wikipedia (which describes Tate as a White Supremacist, despite the fact he is mixed Race).<br><br>If you take the authority over Women as an example, she thinks &quot;you want to own Women, you think they are property&quot;, where he&#39;s like &quot;no, if a Woman wants me to be responsible for her safety, then I should have some kind of authority over e.g. which route we take when talking home, what time is too late to leave the home by herself etc etc&quot;, if Tate has no authority when taking responsibility over someone, then if something happens to said person, Tate has to take all of the heat, using Dogs and Children as an Analogy (not comparison) make her think &quot;so you think that Women are no different to Dogs and kids&quot;.
Sentiment: Negative

Text: God bless your soul Andrew Tate.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: I actually respect the BBC so much more now. This is brilliant. <br>Not because it&#39;s a perfect interview. I definitely think it could&#39;ve been done better. The media had become very opinionated, flooded with personal opinions and agendas, which does stink but... Am I really the only one bothered by how Andrew is always so full of himself? I mean I&#39;m no therapist (but have been taking a deep interest in psychology for years), but to me - he shows absolutely zero empathy and stinks like a narcissist and that&#39;s EXACTLY what Lucy was trying to show with her questions (IMO), sadly nobody uses their head to analyse stuff and it&#39;s always &quot;LOOK HE WON HE&#39;S GOOD&quot; or &quot;HE SUCKS HE&#39;S MISOGYNIST&quot;. The real essence of things is usually much more  granular and complex, it&#39;s much more grey than black and white.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: They‚Äôve been doing this for years people they done the same thing to Michael Jackson but he was too kind to fight back, Andrew is a smart man and he makes sure to remind us that it‚Äôs the higher ups that are behind all this we all need to wake up and stop soaking up the lies like sponges üßΩ
Sentiment: Positive

Text: How clear it is they had an agenda to try make him look bad backfired! nothing fair or unbais about reporting or journalism now days... just corrupt corrupt media trying to put the blame on a few outspoken people not looking at real problems in society where people (kids and adults) are being repressed, manipulated, controlled by governments, corruptions.... one man can&#39;t do all the damage they&#39;re trying to claim he&#39;s done to an entire country more people haven&#39;t heard of tate then have until now üòÇ so fucking dum fuck the systems that controll us people will fight back and together we are more powerful then they&#39;re üòÇüòÇüòÇ can feel the big cats shaking in their boots üñï

Text: Prophecy effect?? Can it be possible that Dajjal aka AntiChrist team is heavily concerned with the revelation of Mehdi A.S.- A warrior of Islamic prophecy who would bring together all Muslim nations to fight against Dajjal. Right now, Andrew Tate is not on that level but nobody knows the upcoming future. What if, they are afraid the moment Andrew Tate accepted Islam and they thought that Andrew Tate may forgive himself and ask forgiveness for his sinful acts in past and come out as a very strong muslim and become the Mehdi A.S. as mentioned in prophecy!? So, they don&#39;t want to take the risk even if it is 1% and eliminate the danger to Dajjal aka Anti Christ and his plans especially to spread woke culture everywhere, make everyone become casual and synonymous with sins and men to behave like Lil princess and women to become degenerate..

Text: She is an absolute activist, a feminist, non genuine journalist, listening to her non research, fact finding garbage questions says it all, and at the end of the interview, you can see she was bitter and didnt even thank him for the interview but he did, way to go Tateüëçüëçüëçüëç
Sentiment: Negative

Text: This was one of the most frustrating interviews I&#39;ve ever seen. Idk how he managed to keep his cool with her. All she did was repeat baseless allegations at him like a robot without actually listening to what he&#39;s saying. He handled it fairly well. The one thing that I&#39;m not a fan of is his lack of modesty üòÖ The way he kept repeating things like &quot; I am a force of good, and have a positive influence on the world&quot;, because even if it&#39;s true one shouldn&#39;t really say that. I understand he&#39;s being defensive cause he&#39;s being accused of being a bad person but still he shouldn&#39;t say it like that. And the last statement about being &quot;the most influential/Googled  person on the face of the planet&quot; also sounded really arrogant. And tbh I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very accurate. Like maybe he was the most Googled person at a point in time but that doesn&#39;t mean that he always is the most Googled one. And it also doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s the most influential. Googling someone&#39;s name is not equal to being influenced by them. And frankly I had never heard of him before he became a Muslim, and most of the people I know didn&#39;t either and some still don&#39;t know him at all. So I fear that this Google statistic got to his head too much. But hopefully that changes in time. Especially that Islam condemns arrogance. Anyhow, May Allah bless him and help him in this war against him.

Sentiment: Positive

Text: The fact that he did this interview as per his actions against biased media shows he could have done this with some known person and he still tryna make people understand what‚Äôs happening, so the people who are against him totally but not partially it‚Äôs certainly uncivilised manner to set your narrative.

That WE STAND WITH ANDREW.  STOP TAKING SHORT SENTENCES OUT OF A 3 H CONVERSATION TO USE IT OUT OF CONTEXT TO THEN SATANISE PEOPLE FOR YOUR AGENDA. AS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA LIKES TO DO IT WITH ANDREW OR JORDAN PETERSON AND OTHER CELEBS. THE WORLD IS WAKING UP MORE AND MORE, nobody believes your BS no more. We all know what is truly dangerous to our society. Big cooperation who still exploiting 3rd world countries for resources like cobalt and more, controlled media that pushes everybody to think a certain way etc. And if you don&#39;t believe me go and ask all-mighty ChatGPT who collected tones of Data about the power misuse of people and corporations and the establishment though-out history. Everybody who believes it doesn&#39;t exist anymore is fooled by every other distraction that the media puts out. The establishment are the ones who actually possess real power like JP. Morgan and Vanguard group or other rich rich individuals who basically own everything. Not to mention the political influence that comes with it, when you have that big amount of money to inject political campaigns and the contacts they have in every branch of all three societal power structures. Dangerous are not influencers like Andrew Tate, who isn&#39;t even a billionaire. And what is a billion for those companies? Nothing. Where the money flows power goes. END OF STORY

And also donating a lot alot a lot a lot of money to charities shows how a good of a man he is and every boy and man should take him as a role model. <br><br>So before accusing him of false accusations think aboht what good he has done to the world. <br><br>I raise my case

Text: Is she truly a BBC reporter? Pardon my ignorance but nothing she did there showed true journalism. Her line of questioning was very leading and she should have known Andrew is too learned to fall for that. It‚Äôs amazing how well Andrew remembers these comments and the contexts in which they were made. If he is guilty off anything, may the law have its course. But trying to ask such incriminating questions were wrong on the journalist‚Äôs part.

The problem with the way she has executed this interview, is that her arguments are weak, and backed by no fact. Genuinely disappointing that Tate hasn‚Äôt been able to respond to real questions, with real statistics.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: I wish I was the one interviewing him, I would have been professional and I would&#39;ve not antagonized him like she&#39;s doing. And I also would have brought up some points that I would like him to clarify:<br><br>The voice note that he sent to the woman he allegedly raped (I would like to know what was the whole context behind that)<br>The statement he made saying that men can cheat while women can&#39;t (it doesn&#39;t really make sense)<br>The tweet he made saying that women should bear some responsibilities when they&#39;re raped (that was so wrong, but I would like to know what he meant, what kind of situation he was referring to)<br>Also, he says that a woman belong to her husband and I would like to know if he also believes that a man belongs to his wife cause that would make sense and not sound so wrong after all<br><br>This interview was ridiculous, I don&#39;t know why they sent her, she so obviously hates him and came with an agenda.

Text: thank you andrew for making the world a better place
Sentiment: Positive

Text: Both of these individuals handled this interview in a very heated way and neither took some responsibility. Andrew has said some very disturbing things about women and how they should be treated. The interviewer didn‚Äôt just pull these out of a hat or some random place - you can find a reputable lawyer discussing and citing some of the very things the reporter sites here: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gs5b04hnfMQ">https://youtu.be/Gs5b04hnfMQ</a><br><br>I believe no human is either all good or all bad, and the reporter came with a very strong angle unfortunately, but Andrew flat out lied about what he‚Äôs said and wanted to keep ‚Äúim a great human being‚Äù angle which isn‚Äôt true either. Understandably he‚Äôs under trial and needs to keep that angle, but some things she sites he‚Äôs very much said and he needs to own that he says some incredibly foul things, and he‚Äôs human and can grow and no matter what happens to him I hope he finds some ways to shift his messaging about how men should treat women, maybe not all of it but definitely some of it.

Don&#39;t know which one is the real one or which version his true character really is. A mixture of them both? I don&#39;t know, also when he was arrested could see it being true because of his online persona, however always believe innocent until proven guilty and should be treat as such. Most of the interviews he does he is very good, articulate and precise in everything he says and 9-10 comes off better than the interviewer however, in this he was very deflective and reluctant to clear up things from her loaded questions. Kept repeating statements she had made earlier even when it had nothing to do with the question she asked.

Sentiment: Negative

Text: BBC went in there with their personal agenda, but actually did Andrew Tate a favor.
Sentiment: Positive

Text: This woman is an embarrassment. She has not done her homework properly, all hearsay. BB‚Ç¨ is crap and how this network still survives is questionable.<br>Emotional manipulation crap!!!! That‚Äôs what everyone used and abused who has no evidence but ruins anyone if they don‚Äôt get what they wanted.<br>She doesn‚Äôt even interested with the conversation but only focused on her questions and accusing him of manipulation. She is inventing things. She is rephrasing his statement and it‚Äôs all wrong. Andrew T is very intelligent and articulated.  While she us wrecking herself and doing a very poor job.<br>She should go and interview men in Middle East countries. <br>He has answered your questions but she has got nothing to him except relying on something read on the media.

Text: She is obviously a man hater that‚Äôs on a mission to try to destroy a masculine man. I wish Andrew would have kicked her out. She already has her predetermined narrative. Meanwhile the bbc kisses the ass of the biggest human traffickers in history the royal family.
Sentiment: Negative

Text: I actually felt sorry for her.. she should have called in sick that day.<br><br>She will tell her grandchildren about the day she met Tate!
Sentiment: Negative

Text: The BBC whilst trash they are still huge it‚Äôs actually bizarre they sent this emotional underprepared amateur . She really dropped the ball . Huge opportunity and has come out of it making herself look like a dope and tate very calm collected and pretty much the only sane one of the two . <br><br>I would of thrown her out the front door . Tate better man than me in that regard .

Sentiment: Negative

Text: Andrew is just being a man in whatever he says. In most African society his philosophy of what men are is still the philosophy of 99% of men. This new age nonsense of trying to suppress the Y chromosome is unbelievable. Men designed this world and so we shall continue doing whatever we want. Wise women know this and play along.

Text: The BBC helped make Tate possible, just as they helped make Trump possible. They still haven&#39;t learned their lesson. They&#39;re still operating from a neoliberal-globalist, elitist ivory tower, which helps make the Tates and Trumps of the world more appealing.

Text: Nothing but absolute absurdity and nothing but a whitewash and witch hunt. You can see her going red in the face. The point about police and different organisations naming Andrew as a bad influence cannot be credible as they are government funded, much like the BBC is. They are further proving that this is a matrix attack. I pray Andrew clears his name and lives a happy carefree life.

Text: This &quot;interview&quot; is an absolutely fucking joke. This women did absolutely no research like Andrew said. Just taking things completely out of context and trying to accuse him of shit. Why not ask more important shit about how he feels about being falsely accused,  wrongly imprisoned with absolutely no evidence.  Idc who you are, if you are forced to be held in jail or prison for over 3 months with ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE against it, is just absolutely fucked up and an injust, misuse of power! Lady came here with only one agenda rather then just ask questions to both sides of this. What a joke. Top G for the win.

Sentiment: Positive

Text: Woman who stand with Andrew‚ù§ She was totally unprepared to interview Andrew. I hope she goes home and watches this interview back and sees how ridiculous she made herself look. Did her 5 year old daughter write these questions? this is beyond embarrassing. Andrew being the most dangerous man in the world is she serious??? does she know what‚Äôs happening in North Korea? China, Russia lady if Andrew is the most dangerous man in the England has lost their mind if that is the conversation in England.
Sentiment: Negative
